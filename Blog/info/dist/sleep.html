    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">People who get only six hours of sleep a night have been found to have a waist circumference that is three centimetres greater than those who sleep for nine hours.

<br>As per a study conducted by the researchers from the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, people who have improper sleep schedules have a higher possibility of being overweight and obese and develop serious metabolic disorders such as diabetes.

<br>The researchers enrolled 1,615 adults and noted their sleep duration and dietary intake. Blood samples from each participant were obtained, and their weight, waist circumference, and blood pressures were recorded.

<br>The potential relationship between sleep duration, diet, weight, and other metabolic parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose and thyroid function was studied.

<br>The results demonstrated that inadequate sleep had a possible connection with decreased HDL cholesterol, which is considered ‘good’ cholesterol, as it keeps the heart healthy. It was also shown that the obesity resulting from poor sleep patterns was responsible for the development of Type-2 diabetes.Together, these findings underscore the importance of getting around seven to nine hours of sleep daily to maintain good health.

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Waist measurement can reflect visceral fat

</h3>
    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Stored deeper under the skin than subcutaneous fat, visceral fat builds up around organs like the liver, the pancreas and the intestines. It affects hormonal function and the body's resistance to insulin, and can lead to inflammation, hence the associated risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Waist measurement could also predict cancer risk, according to a study published May 24 in the British Journal of Cancer. An extra 11 centimeters around the waistline increased the risk of cancer by 13%. In the case of bowel cancer, eight centimeters more fat around the hips was linked to an increased risk of 15%.

To fulfil the realistic objective of getting seven to nine hours' sleep per night, recommendations include maximizing exposure to natural sunlight during the day, switching lie-ins for naps at the weekend, avoiding caffeine six hours before bedtime, taking exercise, skipping foods that are too high in fat or sugar in the evening or drinking alcohol.</p>
