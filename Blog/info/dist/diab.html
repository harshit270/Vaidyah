    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">A healthy diet along with other modifiable factors such as exercise, regular medical check-ups and a healthy lifestyle are amongst the few parameters that play a very critical role in managing diabetes. It is important for people with diabetes to know what foods may serve as the best options for them. Ideally, they should prefer food with low glycemic index (GI).

Glycemic index is a number that tells us about the effect of food on a person’s blood sugar level. It has a scale between 0 to 100, where 100 is pure glucose. While low GI foods do not raise blood sugar level quickly, high GI foods will bring an instant spike in your sugar levels. Simply put, the higher the glycemic index of a food, the quicker it raises your sugar levels. So, prefer foods having a low GI. Roughly,

<br>– GI value below 50 is considered low.

<br>– GI value between 50 ‐60 is considered average.

<br>– GI value above 60 is high.

<br>Let us have a look at the available options of low glycemic index foods for people with diabetes:

<br>1 . Chickpeas (Kabuli Channa)

<br>-Considered as one of the healthy foods, it is a good salad option for many. It helps to prevent spikes in the sugar levels and is, therefore, a great option for the diabetics.

<br>2 . Beans

<br>-Broadly all the different types of beans, namely the kidney beans, white beans and black beans, serve as a rich source of carbohydrates, lean protein and fiber. Regular intake of beans has been found to regulate blood sugar levels.

<br>3 . Broccoli

<br>-For a while now, broccoli has topped the charts across diet plans and is considered as one of the healthiest foods for the diabetics. High in fiber and low in carbohydrates, broccoli along with other greens such as spinach effectively keeps a check on the sugar levels.

<br>4 . Whole Grain Bread

<br>-Studies suggest that whole grain bread, unlike white bread, significantly improves the insulin sensitivity in the human body. The coarser the bread is, the better it is for absorption and digestion.

<br>5 . Oatmeal

<br>-Oatmeal serves as a storehouse of soluble fiber and as a result, slows the absorption of glucose from food in the stomach. It also helps to keep you full for longer hours and is therefore considered as a good breakfast option.

<br>6 . Apples

<br>-As has been rightly observed and said, an apple a day shall help to keep the doctor away. Apple is a rich source of several vitamins, minerals and fiber. Rather than hopping onto candies for sweeter options, you must grab an apple each day as it has a low GI ad is packed with nutrients. Other low GI fruits include strawberries, black jamun, orange, etc. Fruits like banana and mango are high GI fruits. Whenever eating such fruits, make sure to eat them in moderation.

<br>7 . Bitter Gourd (Karela)

<br>-Bitter in taste, however bitter gourd houses several health benefits. It contains three active anti-diabetic compounds that help to manage diabetes effectively. Charanthin, a compound found in bitter gourd, helps to keep the glucose levels low and sugar under control.

So, go ahead and add these amazing low glycemic index foods to your daily diet.

<br>Eat Healthy, Stay Happy!
